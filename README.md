Description:
This calculator app was my second mini project in my full stack journey. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation and arithmetic logic implementation.
I created this app by following the “100K Coding Challenge” on Brototype’s Malayalam YouTube channel during August 2024. I'm currently continuing my learning through Brocamp — a 7-month full-time offline program to become a professional full stack developer.

CSS

JavaScript

Deployed on Vercel

Key Highlights:

Clean, mobile-friendly UI

Fully functional operations: +, –, ×, ÷

Clear button and responsive display output

Strengthened core logic and event handling skills
